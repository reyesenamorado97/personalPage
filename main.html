    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I am a student at the University at Buffalo who is studying
        <br>
        Computer Science. Originally, my interest was in Mathematical Sciences,
        <br>
        I've had a change of heart and have found my new passion.<br>
        Planning, writing, and executing code provides me a sense <br>
        reward, which no other subject has been able to do for me. <br>
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>My primary focus is my education and expanding my knowledge. <br>
       During the Spring 2022 semester, I participated in Codepath's iOS <br>
       development bootcamp and earned a spot in the National Demo Day as <br>
       one of the best 10 apps in the country. Currently, under Schmitd Futures and <br>
        Codepath, I am participating in the SITE internship program for 
       full-stack web development.
    </p> 

    <br>

    <h2>On the Radar...</h2>
    <p>Mobile development is my favorite kind of programming because it is so <br>
        simple and easy to show my family all the useful and easy-to-use apps <br>
        I can make for them. They stray far away from the app store because <br>
        of a langauge barrier, and I want to change that a great scale. <br>
    </p>
